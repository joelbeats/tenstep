                <h3>Here are the 12 Steps as defined by Alcoholics Anonymous: We admitted we were powerless over alcohol–that our lives had become unmanageable:</h3>
                <ol> 
                    <li>Came to believe that a Power greater than ourselves could restore us to sanity.</li>
                    <li>Made a decision to turn our will and our lives over to the care of God as we understood Him.</li>
                    <li>Made a searching and fearless moral inventory of ourselves.</li>
                    <li>Admitted to God, to ourselves and to another human being the exact nature of our wrongs.</li>
                    <li>Were entirely ready to have God remove all these defects of character</li>
                    <li>Humbly asked Him to remove our shortcomings</li>
                    <li>Made a list of persons we had harmed, and became willing to make amends to them all.</li>
                    <li>Made direct amends to such people wherever possible, except when to do so would injure them or others.</li>
                    <li>Continued to take personal inventory and when we were wrong promptly admitted it.</li>
                    <li>Sought through prayer and meditation to improve our conscious contact with God as we understood Him, praying only for knowledge of His will for us and the power to carry that out.</li>
                    <li>Having had a spiritual awakening as the result of these steps, we tried to carry this message to alcoholics and to practice these principles in all our affairs.</li>

                <h2>About</h2>
                <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Addiction" alt="Link to AA">Read More at Wikipedia</a>
                <p>Addiction is a brain disorder characterized by compulsive engagement in rewarding stimuli despite adverse consequences. 
                    Despite the involvement of a number of psychosocial factors, 
                    a biological process—one that is induced by repeated exposure to an addictive stimulus—is the core pathology that drives the development and maintenance of an addiction, 
                    according to the "brain disease model" of addiction. 
                    However, many scholars who study addiction argue that the brain disease model is incomplete and misleading. 
                    Addiction is a disorder of the brain's reward system which arises through transcriptional and epigenetic mechanisms and develops over time from chronically high levels of exposure to an addictive stimulus 
                    (e.g., eating food, the use of cocaine, engagement in sexual activity, participation in high-thrill cultural activities such as gambling, etc.). 
                    DeltaFosB (ΔFosB), a gene transcription factor, is a critical component and common factor in the development of virtually all forms of behavioral and drug addictions. 
                    Two decades of research into ΔFosB's role in addiction have demonstrated that addiction arises, and the associated compulsive behavior intensifies or attenuates, along with the overexpression of ΔFosB in the D1-type medium spiny neurons of the nucleus accumbens. 
                    Due to the causal relationship between ΔFosB expression and addictions, it is used preclinically as an addiction biomarker.
                    ΔFosB expression in these neurons directly and positively regulates drug self-administration and reward sensitization through positive reinforcement, while decreasing sensitivity to aversion. 
                    Addiction exacts an "astoundingly high financial and human toll" on individuals and society as a whole. 
                    In the United States, the total economic cost to society is greater than that of all types of diabetes and all cancers combined. 
                    These costs arise from the direct adverse effects of drugs and associated healthcare costs (e.g., emergency medical services and outpatient and inpatient care), long-term complications (e.g., lung cancer from smoking tobacco products, 
                    liver cirrhosis and dementia from chronic alcohol consumption, and meth mouth from methamphetamine use), the loss of productivity and associated welfare costs, fatal and non-fatal accidents (e.g., traffic collisions), 
                    suicides, homicides, and incarceration, among others. 
                    Classic hallmarks of addiction include impaired control over substances or behavior, preoccupation with substance or behavior, and continued use despite consequences. 
                    Habits and patterns associated with addiction are typically characterized by immediate gratification (short-term reward), coupled with delayed deleterious effects (long-term costs). 
                    Examples of drug and behavioral addictions include alcoholism, marijuana addiction, amphetamine addiction, cocaine addiction, nicotine addiction, opioid addiction, food addiction, chocolate addiction, video game addiction, 
                    gambling addiction, and sexual addiction. The only behavioral addiction recognized by the DSM-5 and the ICD-10 is gambling addiction. With the introduction of the ICD-11 gaming addiction was appended. 
                    The term addiction is misused frequently to refer to other compulsive behaviors or disorders, particularly dependence, in news media. 
                    An important distinction between drug addiction and dependence is that drug dependence is a disorder in which cessation of drug use results in an unpleasant state of withdrawal, which can lead to further drug use.
                    Addiction is the compulsive use of a substance or performance of a behavior that is independent of withdrawal. Addiction can occur in the absence of dependence, and dependence can occur in the absence of addiction, 
                    although the two often occur together.</p>

                <p>A drug is any substance that causes a change in an organism's physiology or psychology when consumed. Drugs are typically distinguished from food and substances that provide nutritional support. Consumption of drugs can be via inhalation, injection, smoking, ingestion, absorption via a patch on the skin, or dissolution under the tongue. In pharmacology, a drug is a chemical substance, typically of known structure, which, when administered to a living organism, produces a biological effect. A pharmaceutical drug, also called a medication or medicine, is a chemical substance used to treat, cure, prevent, or diagnose a disease or to promote well-being. Traditionally drugs were obtained through extraction from medicinal plants, but more recently also by organic synthesis.[6] Pharmaceutical drugs may be used for a limited duration, or on a regular basis for chronic disorders. Pharmaceutical drugs are often classified into drug classes—groups of related drugs that have similar chemical structures, the same mechanism of action (binding to the same biological target), a related mode of action, and that are used to treat the same disease.[8][9] The Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical Classification System (ATC), the most widely used drug classification system, assigns drugs a unique ATC code, which is an alphanumeric code that assigns it to specific drug classes within the ATC system. Another major classification system is the Biopharmaceutics Classification System. This classifies drugs according to their solubility and permeability or absorption properties. Psychoactive drugs are chemical substances that affect the function of the central nervous system, altering perception, mood or consciousness. These drugs are divided into different groups like: stimulants, depressants, antidepressants, anxiolytics, antipsychotics, and hallucinogens. These psychoactive drugs have been proven useful in treating wide range of medical conditions including mental disorders around the world. The most widely used drugs in the world include caffeine, nicotine and alcohol, which are also considered recreational drugs, since they are used for pleasure rather than medicinal purposes. Abuse of several psychoactive drugs can cause psychological or physical addiction. It's worth noting that all drugs can have potential side effects. Excessive use of stimulants can promote stimulant psychosis. Many recreational drugs are illicit and international treaties such as the Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs exist for the purpose of their prohibition.</p>

                <h2>Alcohol</h2>
                <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alcohol" alt="Link to Wikipedia"><img class="drugs-pic" src="/img/alcohol.jpg" alt="Alcohol picture"></a>
                <p>Alcohol and Alcoholism is a bimonthly peer-reviewed medical journal covering alcoholism and other health effects of alcohol. It was established in 1963 as the Bulletin on Alcoholism, with H.D. Chalke as the founding editor. In 1968, it was renamed the Journal of Alcoholism, and in 1977, it was again renamed, this time to British Journal on Alcohol and Alcoholism. In 1983, it obtained its current name. It is co-owned and co-published by the Medical Council on Alcohol (MCA) along with Oxford University Press, which bought a 50% stake in the journal in 2011.[2] It is the official journal of both the MCA and the European Society for Biomedical Research on Alcoholism. The editors-in-chief are Jonathan D. Chick (Castle Craig Hospital), Philippe de Witte (Université Catholique de Louvain), and Lorenzo Leggio (Bethesda, MD, USA). According to the Journal Citation Reports, the journal has a 2015 impact factor of 2.724, ranking it 7th out of 18 journals in the category "Substance Abuse".</p>
                <h2>Cocaine</h2>
                <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cocaine" alt="Link to Wikipedia"><img class="drugs-pic" src="/img/cocaine.jpeg" alt="Cocaine picture"></a>
                <p>Cocaine, also known as coke, is a strong stimulant most frequently used as a recreational drug. It is commonly snorted, inhaled as smoke, or dissolved and injected into a vein. Mental effects may include an intense feeling of happiness, loss of contact with reality, or agitation. Physical symptoms may include a fast heart rate, sweating, and large pupils. High doses can result in very high blood pressure or body temperature. Effects begin within seconds to minutes of use and last between five and ninety minutes. Cocaine has a small number of accepted medical uses such as numbing and decreasing bleeding during nasal surgery. Cocaine is addictive due to its effect on the reward pathway in the brain. After a short period of use, there is a high risk that dependence will occur. Its use also increases the risk of stroke, myocardial infarction, lung problems in those who smoke it, blood infections, and sudden cardiac death. Cocaine sold on the street is commonly mixed with local anesthetics, cornstarch, quinine, or sugar, which can result in additional toxicity. Following repeated doses a person may have decreased ability to feel pleasure and be very physically tired. Cocaine acts by inhibiting the reuptake of serotonin, norepinephrine, and dopamine. This results in greater concentrations of these three neurotransmitters in the brain. It can easily cross the blood–brain barrier and may lead to the breakdown of the barrier. In 2013, 419 kilograms were produced legally. It is estimated that the illegal market for cocaine is 100 to US$500 billion each year. With further processing, crack cocaine can be produced from cocaine. Cocaine is the second most frequently used illegal drug globally, after cannabis. Between 14 and 21 million people use the drug each year. Use is highest in North America followed by Europe and South America. Between one and three percent of people in the developed world have used cocaine at some point in their life. In 2013, cocaine use directly resulted in 4,300 deaths, up from 2,400 in 1990. It is named after the coca plant from which it is isolated. The plant's leaves have been used by Peruvians since ancient times. Cocaine was first isolated from the leaves in 1860. Since 1961, the international Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs has required countries to make recreational use of cocaine a crime.</p>    
                <h2>Opiate</h2>
                <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opiate" alt="Link to Wikipedia"><img class="drugs-pic" src="/img/opiate.jpeg" alt="Opiate picture"></a>
                <p>Opiate is a term classically used in pharmacology to mean a drug derived from opium. Opioid, a more modern term, is used to designate all substances, both natural and synthetic, that bind to opioid receptors in the brain (including antagonists).[1] Opiates are alkaloid compounds naturally found in the opium poppy plant Papaver somniferum.[2] The psychoactive compounds found in the opium plant include morphine, codeine, and thebaine. Opiates have long been used for a variety of medical conditions with evidence of opiate trade and use for pain relief as early as the eighth century AD.[3] Opiates are considered drugs with moderate to high abuse potential and are listed on various "Substance-Control Schedules" under the Uniform Controlled Substances Act of the United States of America. In 2014, between 13 and 20 million people used opiates recreationally (0.3% to 0.4% of the global population between the ages of 15 and 65). According to the CDC, from this population, there has been a recorded 47,000 deaths with a total of a half a million deaths from 2000–2014. In 2016, the World Health Organization reported that 27 million people suffer from opioid abuse disorder. They also reported that in 2015, 450,000 people died as a result of drug use, with between a third and a half of that number being attributed to opioids.</p>

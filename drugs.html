                <h2>Alcohol</h2>
                <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alcohol" alt="Link to Wikipedia"><img class="drugs-pic" src="/img/alcohol.jpg" alt="Alcohol picture"></a>
                <p>Alcohol and Alcoholism is a bimonthly peer-reviewed medical journal covering alcoholism and other health effects of alcohol. It was established in 1963 as the Bulletin on Alcoholism, with H.D. Chalke as the founding editor. In 1968, it was renamed the Journal of Alcoholism, and in 1977, it was again renamed, this time to British Journal on Alcohol and Alcoholism. In 1983, it obtained its current name. It is co-owned and co-published by the Medical Council on Alcohol (MCA) along with Oxford University Press, which bought a 50% stake in the journal in 2011.[2] It is the official journal of both the MCA and the European Society for Biomedical Research on Alcoholism. The editors-in-chief are Jonathan D. Chick (Castle Craig Hospital), Philippe de Witte (Université Catholique de Louvain), and Lorenzo Leggio (Bethesda, MD, USA). According to the Journal Citation Reports, the journal has a 2015 impact factor of 2.724, ranking it 7th out of 18 journals in the category "Substance Abuse".</p>
                <h2>Cocaine</h2>
                <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cocaine" alt="Link to Wikipedia"><img class="drugs-pic" src="/img/cocaine.jpeg" alt="Cocaine picture"></a>
                <p>Cocaine, also known as coke, is a strong stimulant most frequently used as a recreational drug. It is commonly snorted, inhaled as smoke, or dissolved and injected into a vein. Mental effects may include an intense feeling of happiness, loss of contact with reality, or agitation. Physical symptoms may include a fast heart rate, sweating, and large pupils. High doses can result in very high blood pressure or body temperature. Effects begin within seconds to minutes of use and last between five and ninety minutes. Cocaine has a small number of accepted medical uses such as numbing and decreasing bleeding during nasal surgery. Cocaine is addictive due to its effect on the reward pathway in the brain. After a short period of use, there is a high risk that dependence will occur. Its use also increases the risk of stroke, myocardial infarction, lung problems in those who smoke it, blood infections, and sudden cardiac death. Cocaine sold on the street is commonly mixed with local anesthetics, cornstarch, quinine, or sugar, which can result in additional toxicity. Following repeated doses a person may have decreased ability to feel pleasure and be very physically tired. Cocaine acts by inhibiting the reuptake of serotonin, norepinephrine, and dopamine. This results in greater concentrations of these three neurotransmitters in the brain. It can easily cross the blood–brain barrier and may lead to the breakdown of the barrier. In 2013, 419 kilograms were produced legally. It is estimated that the illegal market for cocaine is 100 to US$500 billion each year. With further processing, crack cocaine can be produced from cocaine. Cocaine is the second most frequently used illegal drug globally, after cannabis. Between 14 and 21 million people use the drug each year. Use is highest in North America followed by Europe and South America. Between one and three percent of people in the developed world have used cocaine at some point in their life. In 2013, cocaine use directly resulted in 4,300 deaths, up from 2,400 in 1990. It is named after the coca plant from which it is isolated. The plant's leaves have been used by Peruvians since ancient times. Cocaine was first isolated from the leaves in 1860. Since 1961, the international Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs has required countries to make recreational use of cocaine a crime.</p>    
                <h2>Opiate</h2>
                <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opiate" alt="Link to Wikipedia"><img class="drugs-pic" src="/img/opiate.jpeg" alt="Opiate picture"></a>
                <p>Opiate is a term classically used in pharmacology to mean a drug derived from opium. Opioid, a more modern term, is used to designate all substances, both natural and synthetic, that bind to opioid receptors in the brain (including antagonists).[1] Opiates are alkaloid compounds naturally found in the opium poppy plant Papaver somniferum.[2] The psychoactive compounds found in the opium plant include morphine, codeine, and thebaine. Opiates have long been used for a variety of medical conditions with evidence of opiate trade and use for pain relief as early as the eighth century AD.[3] Opiates are considered drugs with moderate to high abuse potential and are listed on various "Substance-Control Schedules" under the Uniform Controlled Substances Act of the United States of America. In 2014, between 13 and 20 million people used opiates recreationally (0.3% to 0.4% of the global population between the ages of 15 and 65). According to the CDC, from this population, there has been a recorded 47,000 deaths with a total of a half a million deaths from 2000–2014. In 2016, the World Health Organization reported that 27 million people suffer from opioid abuse disorder. They also reported that in 2015, 450,000 people died as a result of drug use, with between a third and a half of that number being attributed to opioids.</p>
